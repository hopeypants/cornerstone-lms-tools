## Security Considerations

### Chrome Extension Security

This extension:
- Uses Manifest V3 for enhanced security
- Implements Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Follows Chrome extension security best practices
- Only requests necessary permissions
- Validates all user inputs

### Data Handling

- **No sensitive data collection**: The extension only stores user preferences
- **Local storage only**: Settings are stored locally in Chrome storage
- **No external communication**: No data is sent to external servers
- **CSOD domain only**: Extension only runs on `*.csod.com` domains

### Permissions

The extension requests minimal permissions:
- `storage`: For saving user preferences
- `activeTab`: For interacting with CSOD pages
- `https://*.csod.com/*`: Host permissions for CSOD domains only

## Best Practices for Users

- **Keep your browser updated**: Use the latest version of your browser
- **Review permissions**: Only install extensions from trusted sources
